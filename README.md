## ✨ Feature Breakdown

This project replicates the core functionality of Airbnb, focusing on delivering a complete backend system that supports user interaction, property listing, and seamless booking experiences.

### 👥 User Management
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile updates. This feature allows users to securely access the platform, manage their accounts, and differentiate between guests and hosts.

### 🏠 Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, delete, and retrieve property listings. It provides all the essential tools to manage rental properties, including descriptions, locations, and availability.

### 📅 Booking System
Allows guests to book properties for specific dates and manage their reservations. This feature handles check-in/check-out data and ensures property availability is respected during the booking process.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Supports secure handling of payments related to bookings. It tracks transaction status and ensures financial interactions are properly recorded, contributing to a trustworthy transaction flow.

### 📝 Review System
Lets guests leave feedback and ratings on properties they've booked. This feature enhances transparency, builds community trust, and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 📄 API Documentation (OpenAPI)
All endpoints are documented using the OpenAPI standard. This ensures developers can easily understand and interact with the backend through clearly defined and testable API specifications.

### 🚀 GraphQL API
Provides an alternative to REST with flexible and efficient querying. Developers can request exactly the data they need, reducing payload size and improving frontend/backend coordination.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
Implements caching and database indexing to improve response times and scalability. This ensures smooth performance even as the number of users, listings, and bookings grows.


## 🔐 API Security

Security is a top priority in the development of this backend system. The following measures are implemented to ensure user data, transactions, and platform integrity are fully protected.

### 🔑 Authentication
All API endpoints require secure user authentication using token-based mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  
**Why it matters:** Ensures that only verified users can access their account and perform authorized actions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or identity theft.

### 🛂 Authorization
Role-based access control is used to differentiate between users (e.g., guest vs. host vs. admin).  
**Why it matters:** Protects sensitive operations—such as modifying properties or accessing bookings—ensuring users only perform actions allowed by their role.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse of the APIs through spamming or brute force attacks.  
**Why it matters:** Helps maintain service availability and protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or excessive usage by malicious actors.

### 🧊 Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details are encrypted in transit and at rest.  
**Why it matters:** Protects user credentials and financial data from being intercepted or leaked, enhancing overall platform trustworthiness.

### 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization
All input data is validated and sanitized before processing.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption, ensuring the system handles only clean, expected data.

### 💸 Secure Payment Processing
Payment-related endpoints are protected with heightened security measures including transaction validation and secure third-party integrations.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents fraud and ensures that financial transactions are handled safely and correctly.

### 📝 Audit Logging
All sensitive actions (e.g., payments, bookings, user changes) are logged for auditing and traceability.  
**Why it matters:** Helps detect suspicious behavior, support incident investigations, and meet compliance requirements.
